## Quick start

This is the Python JAX implementation for *DiBS*  ([Lorch et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11839)), a fully differentiable method for joint Bayesian inference of the DAG and parameters of general, causal Bayesian networks.

The repository consists of two branches:

- `master` (recommended): Lightweight and easy-to-use package for using DiBS in your research or applications.
- `full`: Comprehensive code to reproduce the experimental results in ([Lorch et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11839)). The purpose of this branch is reproducibility; the branch is not updated anymore and may contain outdated notation and documentation.

In this implementation, DiBS inference is performed with the particle variational inference method *SVGD*  ([Liu and Wang, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04471)). 
Since DiBS and SVGD operate on continuous tensors and solely rely on Monte Carlo estimation and gradient ascent-like updates, the inference code leverages efficient vectorized operations, automatic differentiation, just-in-time compilation, and hardware acceleration, fully implemented with [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). 

The documentation for the API of the `master` branch is linked here: [**Documentation**](https://differentiable-bayesian-structure-learning.readthedocs.io/)


## Quickstart


The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `dibs` package. 
In this example, we use DiBS to generate 20 DAG and parameter samples 
from the joint posterior over Gaussian Bayes nets with means modeled 
by neural networks.

```python
import jax
import jax.random as random
from dibs.inference import JointDiBS
from dibs.target import make_nonlinear_gaussian_model

key = random.PRNGKey(0)

# simulate some data
key, subk = random.split(key)
data, model = make_nonlinear_gaussian_model(key=subk, n_vars=20, graph_prior_str="sf")

# sample 20 DAG and parameter particles from the joint posterior
dibs = JointDiBS(x=data.x, inference_model=model)
key, subk = random.split(key)
gs, thetas = dibs.sample(key=subk, n_particles=20, steps=1000)
```
In the above, the keyword argument `x` for `JointDiBS` is a matrix of shape `[N, d]` and could
be any real-world data set.


## Example Notebooks

For a working example of the above,  we recommend opening our example notebook in Google Colab, which runs **directly from your browser**. 
Whenever a GPU backend is available to JAX, the implementation will automatically leverage it to accelerate its computations. 
Thus, selecting the GPU runtime available in Google Colab will make inference significantly faster.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/larslorch/dibs/blob/master/examples/dibs_joint_colab.ipynb)

Analogous notebooks can be found inside the `examples/` folder.
Executing the code will generate samples from the joint posterior with DiBS and simultaneously visualize the matrices of edge probabilities modeled by the individual particles that are transported by SVGD during inference.

## Installation

The provided code is run with `python`. We recommend using `conda`. First clone the code repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/larslorch/dibs.git
```


If you want to set up a new `conda` environment, you can run the following commands:
```
cd dibs
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate dibs
pip install -e .
```
Note the "`.`" in the last call. 
If you want to use DiBS within an existing `conda` environment or `virtualenv`, you can just run 
```
pip install -e .
```
to set up the `dibs` package.
